Summary

To create a Page Object Model framework for Selenium, we need:


1. Page Object Classes: Representing different pages with their locators and methods.

2. Base Page Class: Providing common functionality and initialization.

3. Test Cases: Using Page Object methods to perform and validate actions.

4. Test Data: Managed for various scenarios.

5. Utilities: For common operations and tasks.

6. Configuration Files: For managing environment-specific settings.
